# Build-an-AI-Enabled-FinTech-B2B-Invoice-Management-Application

In this project, I built a web application to help the
people working in the Accounts Receivable departments in their day-to-day
activities.I build a web application where the users in the Account
Receivable department can :
● View the invoice data from various buyers.
● See various fields/attributes of the invoice(s) from a particular buye
● Perform Data Pre-processing on the invoice data.
● Get account-level analytics to easily visualize and interpret data- EDA and
Feature Engineering.
● Get a prediction of when the invoice is going to get paid.


## Business Overview

### Introduction to B2B Operations:
The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses
work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods
from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same.
This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the
goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting
terminology as “Accounts Receivable”.

“Accounts Receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the
sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts
receivable is typically executed by generating an invoice and either mailing
or electronically delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within
an established timeframe, called credit terms or payment terms.”

Seller business interacts with various businesses and sells goods to all of them
at various times. Hence, the seller business needs to keep track of the total
amount it owes from all the buyers. This involves keeping track of all invoices
from all the buyers. Each invoice will have various important fields like
payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date etc.
The buyer business needs to clear its amount due before the due date. However,
in real-world scenarios, the invoices are not always cleared ie. paid in full
amount by the due date. The date on which a customer clears the payment for
an invoice is called the payment date.
